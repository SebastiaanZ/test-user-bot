# Test User Bot
Test User Bot is a bot specifically developed to test other bots in a development environment. This means that error handling is pretty much absent as this bot is not meant for a production environment. 

The main use of the bot is that it's able to load, unload, and reload cogs on the fly. Just add a cog to the cogs folder and add it using its filename without the .py extension.
